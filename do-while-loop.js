// what is the difference between a while loop and a do-while loop?
// Both a while loop and a do-while loop are similar in that they repeatedly execute a block of code given that the condition being true, the difference is that a while loop will cehck the condition first and if it is true then exeecute the code, while a do-while loop will execute the code first specify within the curly braces and then check the conditional statement. So a while loop is not guranteed to run it will only run if the condition is true whereas the do-while loop is guranteed to run at least once.
