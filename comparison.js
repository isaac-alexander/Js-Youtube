// Comparison Operators:Comparison operators compare two values and return a Boolean value that indicates the relationship between the values. They are used in computer programs to determine if one value is greater than, less than, equal to, or not equal to another value.

// What are the comparison operators?The comparison operators are:

// Greater than: >
// Greater than or equal to: >=
// Less than:<
// Less than or equal to: <=

let num1 = 14;
let num2 = 10;

const isNum1LessThanOrEqualTo = num1 <= num2;

console.log( isNum1LessThanOrEqualTo );
